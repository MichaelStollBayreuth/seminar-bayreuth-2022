# Dirichlet density of primes ‚â° 1 and primes ‚â° 3 mod 4

The goal of this project is to prove

**Theorem.** The sets of primes p ‚â° 1 mod 4 and of primes p ‚â° 3 mod 4 both have 
Dirichlet density 1/2.

This is covered in Ireland-Rosen, ¬ß16.1-2:

## ¬ß1 The Zeta Function

The Riemann zeta function Œ∂(s) is defined by Œ∂(s) = ‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû n‚ÅªÀ¢.
It converges for s > 1 and converges uniformly for s ‚â• 1 + Œ¥ > 1, for each Œ¥ > O.

**Proposition 16.1.1.** For s > 1.
  Œ∂(s) = ‚àè‚Çö (1 - p‚ÅªÀ¢)‚Åª¬π,
where the product is over all primes p > 0.

PROOF. For s > 1, p‚ÅªÀ¢ < 1, so we have (1 - p‚ÅªÀ¢)‚Åª¬π = ‚àë_{m=0}^‚àû p‚Åª·µêÀ¢.
By the theorem of unique factorization
  ‚àè_{p ‚â§ N} (1 - p‚ÅªÀ¢)‚Åª¬π = ‚àë_{n ‚â§ N} n‚ÅªÀ¢ + R_N(s) .
Clearly, R_N(s) ‚â§ ‚àë_{n=N+1}^‚àû n‚ÅªÀ¢. Since Œ∂(s) converges, R_N(s) ‚Üí 0 as N ‚Üí ‚àû. The
result follows. QED

The behavior of Œ∂(s) as s ‚Üí 1 is very important. Since ‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû n‚Åª¬π diverges,
we, of course, suspect Œ∂(s) ‚Üí ‚àû as s ‚Üí 1. In fact,

**Proposition 16.1.2.** Assume s > 1. Then
  lim_{s ‚Üí 1} (s - l) Œ∂(s) = 1.

PROOF. For fixed s, t‚ÅªÀ¢ is a monotone decreasing function of t. Thus,
  (n + 1)‚ÅªÀ¢ < ‚à´_n^{n+1} t‚ÅªÀ¢ dt < n‚ÅªÀ¢ .
Summing from n = 1 to ‚àû,
  Œ∂(s) - 1 < ‚à´_1^‚àû t‚ÅªÀ¢ dt < Œ∂(s) .
The value of the integral is (s - 1)‚Åª¬π. It follows that 1 < (s - 1) Œ∂(s) < s.
Taking the limit as s ‚Üí 1 gives the result. QED

**Corollary.** As s ‚Üí 1 we have
  (ln Œ∂(s))/(ln (s-1)‚Åª¬π) ‚Üí 1 .

PROOF. Let (s - 1) Œ∂(s) = œÅ(s). Then ln(s - 1) + ln Œ∂(s) = ln œÅ(s), so we have
ln Œ∂(s)/ln(s - 1)‚Åª¬π = 1 + (ln œÅ(s))/ln(s - 1)^‚Åª¬π.
As s ‚Üí 1, œÅ(s) ‚Üí 1 by the proposition. Therefore, ln œÅ(s) ‚Üí 0, and the
result follows. QED

**Proposition 16.1.3.** ln Œ∂(s) = ‚àë‚Çö p‚ÅªÀ¢ + R(s), where R(s) remains bounded as
s ‚Üí 1.

PROOF. We use the formula -ln(1 - x) = x + x¬≤/2 + x¬≥/3 + ..., which is
valid for -1 < x < 1.
By Proposition 16.1.1 we have
  Œ∂(s) = ‚àè_{p ‚â§ N} (1 - p‚ÅªÀ¢)‚Åª¬π Œª_N(s) ,
where Œª_N(S) ‚Üí 1 as N ‚Üí ‚àû. Taking the logarithm of both sides yields
ln Œ∂(s) = ‚àë_{p ‚â§ N} ‚àë_{m=1}^‚àû m‚Åª¬π p‚Åª·µêÀ¢ + ln Œª_N(s).
Taking the limit as N ‚Üí ‚àû
  ln Œ∂(s) = ‚àë‚Çö ‚àë_{m=1}^‚àû m‚Åª¬π p‚Åª·µêÀ¢ = ‚àë‚Çö p‚ÅªÀ¢ + ‚àë‚Çö ‚àë_{m=2}^‚àû m‚Åª¬π p‚Åª·µêÀ¢ .
The second sum is less than
  ‚àë‚Çö ‚àë_{m=2}^‚àû p‚Åª·µêÀ¢ = ‚àë‚Çö p‚Åª¬≤À¢ (1 - p‚ÅªÀ¢)‚Åª¬π ‚â§ (1 - 2‚ÅªÀ¢)‚Åª¬π ‚àë‚Çö p‚Åª¬≤À¢ ‚â§ 2 Œ∂(2).
Throughout we have used the assumption that s > 1. QED

**Definition.** A set of positive primes ùí´ is said to have *Dirichlet density* if
  lim_{s ‚Üí 1} (‚àë_{p ‚àà ùí´} p‚ÅªÀ¢)/ln (s-1)‚Åª¬π
exists. If the limit exists we set it equal to d(ùí´) and call d(ùí´) the
*Dirichlet density* of ùí´.

**Proposition 16.1.4.** Let ùí´ be a set of positive prime numbers. Then
(a) If ùí´ is finite, then d(ùí´) = 0.
(b) If ùí´ consists of all but finitely many positive primes, then d(ùí´) = 1.
(c) If ùí´ = ùí´‚ÇÅ ‚à™ ùí´‚ÇÇ where ùí´‚ÇÅ and ùí´‚ÇÇ are disjoint and d(ùí´‚ÇÅ) and d(ùí´‚ÇÇ) both
exist, then d(ùí´) = d(ùí´‚ÇÅ) + d(ùí´‚ÇÇ).

PROOF. Parts (a) and (c) are clear from the definition of Dirichlet density.
Part (b) follows quickly from the corollary to Proposition 16.1.2 and Proposition 16.1.3.
QED

We are now in a position to state the main theorem of this chapter. The
proof will be spread out over the next three sections.

**Theorem 1** (L. Dirichlet). Suppose a, m ‚àà ‚Ñ§, with gcd(a, m) = 1. Let ùí´(a; m) be the
set of positive primes p such that p ‚â° a mod m. Then d(ùí´(a; m)) = 1/œï(m).

Note that Theorem 1 certainly implies ùí´(a; m) is infinite, since if it were
finite, its density would be zero.


## ¬ß2 A Special Case

We will first prove Theorem 1 in the case where m = 4. The basic ideas of the
proof are all present in this special case, but the details are more transparent.
Define a function œá from ‚Ñ§ to {0, ¬±1} as follows; œá(n) = 0 if n is even,
œá(n) = 1 if n ‚â° 1 mod 4, and œá(n) = -1 if n ‚â° 3 mod 4. It is easily seen that
œá(m n) = œá(m) œá(n) for all m, n ‚àà ‚Ñ§.

Define L(s, œá) = ‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû œá(n) n‚ÅªÀ¢ = 1 - 3‚ÅªÀ¢ + 5‚ÅªÀ¢ - 7‚ÅªÀ¢ + ... . For all n
we have |œá(n) n‚ÅªÀ¢| ‚â§ n‚ÅªÀ¢. It follows that the terms of L(s, œá) are dominated in
absolute value by the terms of Œ∂(s). Thus L(s, œá) converges and is continuous
for s > 1. Since œá is completely multiplicative, the proof of Proposition 16.1.1.
shows that
  L(s, œá) = ‚àè‚Çö (1 - œá(p) p‚ÅªÀ¢)^‚Åª¬π .
It is useful to modify Œ∂(s) so as to suppress the even terms. Define Œ∂*(s) = ‚àë{n odd} n‚ÅªÀ¢.
Since
  Œ∂(s) = ‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû n‚ÅªÀ¢ = ‚àë_{n odd} n‚ÅªÀ¢ + ‚àë_{n even} n‚ÅªÀ¢ = Œ∂*(s) + 2‚ÅªÀ¢ Œ∂(s)
we have Œ∂*(s) = (1 - 2‚ÅªÀ¢) Œ∂(s) and so
  Œ∂*(s) = ‚àè_{p odd} (1 - p‚ÅªÀ¢)‚Åª¬π .
Using the method of proof of Proposition 16.1.3 we find
  ln L(s, œá) = ‚àë_{p odd} œá(p) p‚ÅªÀ¢ + R‚ÇÅ(s)                            (i)
    ln Œ∂*(s) = ‚àë_{p odd} p‚ÅªÀ¢ + R‚ÇÇ(s)                                (ii)
where R‚ÇÅ(s) and R‚ÇÇ(s) remain bounded as s ‚Üí 1.

We have 1 + œá(p) = 2 if p ‚â° 1 mod 4 and 1 + œá(p) = 0 if p ‚â° 3 mod 4. Similarly,
1 - œá(p) = 2 if p ‚â° 3 mod 4 and 1 - œá(p) = 0 if p ‚â° 1 mod 4.  From (i) and (ii) we
deduce
  ln Œ∂*(s) + ln L(s, œá) = 2 ‚àë_{p ‚â° 1 mod 4} p‚ÅªÀ¢ + R‚ÇÉ(s)            (iii)
  ln Œ∂*(s) - ln L(s, œá) = 2 ‚àë_{p ‚â° 3 mod 4} p‚ÅªÀ¢ + R‚ÇÑ(s)             (iv)
 where R‚ÇÉ(s) and R‚ÇÑ(s) remain bounded as s ‚Üí 1.

The next step is to show that ln L(s, œá) remains bounded as s ‚Üí 1. To see
this, write
  L(s, œá) = (1 - 3‚ÅªÀ¢) + (5‚ÅªÀ¢ - 7‚ÅªÀ¢) + ... = 1 - (3‚ÅªÀ¢ - 5‚ÅªÀ¢) - (7‚ÅªÀ¢ - 9‚ÅªÀ¢) - ... .
It follows that for all s > 1 we have 2/3 < L(s, œá) < 1. Thus, for s > 1 we have
ln 2/3 < ln L(s, œá) < ln 1 = 0.

As a final preparatory step we note that ln Œ∂*(s) = ln(1 - 2‚ÅªÀ¢) + ln Œ∂(s), so
by the corollary to Proposition 16.1.2. we have ln Œ∂*(s)/ln(s - 1)‚Åª¬π ‚Üí 1 as s ‚Üí 1.

Now divide each term of Equations (iii) and (iv) by ln(s - 1)‚Åª¬π and take
the limit as s ‚Üí 1. The result is

**Proposition 16.2.1.** d(ùí´(1; 4)) = 1/2 and d(ùí´(3; 4)) = 1/2.
